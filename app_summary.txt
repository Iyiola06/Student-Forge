StudyForge - Application Overview & Progress Summary
==================================================

Application Overview
--------------------
StudyForge is a comprehensive, modern EdTech web application designed to help students optimize their learning experience. Built with Next.js (App Router), React, and Tailwind CSS, it offers a suite of tools centered around document processing, active recall, and gamified learning. 

Core Features:
1. Dashboard: A central personalized hub displaying exam readiness, recent activity, and study streaks.
2. Gamifier: A gamification engine that rewards users with XP, Levels, and Badges for completing study tasks.
3. Leaderboard: A competitive global ranking system to encourage engagement.
4. Resources Library: A centralized storage area for users to upload, manage, and view their study materials (PDFs, docs).
5. Google Books Library: An integrated search engine built on the Google Books API, allowing students to seamlessly find public-domain textbooks and educational resources directly within the app.
6. Study History & Analytics: A chronological timeline tracking a user's study sessions and productivity.
7. AI Generator / Flashcards / Quizzes (Core Concept): Tools designed to transform uploaded resources into actionable study aids like flashcards and multiple-choice quizzes.

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS (for premium aesthetics).
- Backend / Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL).
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (Email/Password, Google OAuth, Apple OAuth).
- Architecture: Client and Server component separation, relying on Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for data privacy.

Progress & Accomplishments So Far
---------------------------------
We have comprehensively refactored the StudyForge application from a static frontend template into a dynamic, data-driven application connected to a live backend.

1. Database & Schema Architecture
   - Designed and implemented a robust PostgreSQL schema in Supabase.
   - Created tables for `profiles`, `resources`, `quizzes`, `flashcards`, `study_history`, and `past_questions`.
   - Enforced stringent Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own private data, while keeping global resources public.
   - Set up automated database triggers to create a `profile` row whenever a new user signs up via Supabase Auth.
   - Created SQL seed scripts to populate initial dummy data (e.g., global past questions).

2. Authentication Redesign
   - Hand-wired the existing custom UI for `/login` and `/signup` to communicate directly with Supabase Auth API routes.
   - Implemented standard Email/Password authentication.
   - Integrated robust OAuth flows for both Google and Apple login options.

3. Complete UI Refactoring (Static to Dynamic)
   - Extracted highly duplicated code (like the Sidebar and Top Navigation) into modular, reusable Next.js Layout Components.
   - Developed a `useProfile` hook to fetch and display the personalized data (Name, Avatar, Level, XP) of the currently logged-in user across the app.
   - Replaced all hardcoded "demo" data (e.g., "Jane Doe", static XP bars, static tables) across the `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/gamifier`, and `/leaderboard` pages with live, dynamic Supabase data.
   - Fixed Next.js 15 routing/build errors by properly assigning `'use client'` directives to pages utilizing React Hooks.

4. Advanced Feature Integrations
   - Added loading spinners and "Empty States" for personalized tables (e.g., showing a friendly "No resources found" message when a new user first signs up).
   - Integrated the Google Books API into the `/resources` page, giving users a dual-purpose library where they can manage their own uploads or search the global Google Books repository for downloadable PDFs and study materials, complete with offline localStorage caching.

Next Steps / Remaining Work:
----------------------------
The application's structural foundation, database layer, authentication, and core personalized UI are fully operational. Moving forward, the focus should shift to the core logic of the application:
1. Actually processing uploaded PDFs in the Resources and Generator pages to extract text.
2. Hooking up an AI Service (like OpenAI) to automatically generate flashcards and quizzes from the extracted text.
3. Implementing the front-end interactive state for taking quizzes and reviewing flashcards.
